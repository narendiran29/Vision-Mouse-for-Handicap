ABSTRACT  
Advancements in technology continue to revolutionize the way we interact with our devices, and one such 
innovation that holds immense potential for transforming accessibility is the development of an eye
controlled mouse. This groundbreaking project introduces a novel method of computer interaction, enabling 
individuals to navigate and operate their computers using only their eyes. By leveraging the capabilities of a 
camera to monitor facial movements, this system detects specific eye gestures such as blinks or controlled eye 
closures, translating them into mouse movements and clicks. What emerges is a seamless and intuitive 
interface that empowers users to interact with their computers hands-free, transcending the limitations 
imposed by traditional input devices . At its core, this eye-controlled mouse is a testament to the power of 
inclusive design. By catering to the needs of individuals with disabilities, it promotes inclusivity in 
technology, ensuring that everyone, regardless of physical limitations, can access and utilize digital resources 
with ease. For those who face challenges with conventional input methods due to motor impairments or other 
disabilities, this innovation represents a gateway to a world of possibilities. It provides a means of 
independent computer usage, granting users autonomy over their digital experiences and fostering a sense of 
empowerment . One of the key advantages of this eye-controlled mouse is its customizable sensitivity, 
allowing users to fine-tune the system according to their individual preferences and capabilities. This level of 
personalization ensures a tailored user experience, maximizing comfort and usability for each individual. 
Whether adjusting the sensitivity to accommodate subtle eye movements or refining the response time to suit 
specific needs, users have the flexibility to optimize their interaction with the technology.
